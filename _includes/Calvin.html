        <p>Hello, my name is Calvin Wong, a Development Intern at Draft Studios. 
            I chose to work as an intern here at Draft Studios because I enjoy programming 
            and the processes in creating a website or software. I am majoring in Computer Science
            at Drexel University because of my passion for programming and the algorithsm surrounding it.
            Some of my personal hobbies include long-distance runs, basketball, and video games like 
            League of Legends and Valorant. 
        </p>
